Isobot is a simple discord.py-based Python Discord bot made by the [NKA Development Team](https://github.com/PyBotDevs), to represent the original [Heckerbot](https://github.com/notsniped/heckerbot) in an even more efficient, fast, contributable, community-focused and enhanced way.

This open-source project was supposed to represent what the next-generation of Heckerbot will look like, and here it is in full-swing, since 2020.
