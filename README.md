Isobot lazer is a brand-new rewrite of the original isobot codebase made by the [NKA Development Team](https://github.com/PyBotDevs), as a version of isobot which is even sharper than before.

This open-source project was supposed to represent what the next-generation of isobot will look like, and now it's finally in the present.

## Why a new project?
At that time, I wanted to make brand new, cutting-edge features for the old isobot codebase. But in the process, I ran into some codeblocks which prevented me from doing so efficiently. This is why I decided to completely rewrite isobot as codename 'lazer' which is meant to be more future-proof. And it sure was.

## How can I help?
***PLEASE SUBMIT ISSUES AND PULL REQUESTS TO THE REPOSITORY!*** It helps us make our work easier c:

## When can I expect a fully-made version?
Maybe not anytime soon...

## When the project's development is complete, what will happen?
***Our project development is complete!*** We will still however update our project and add a **load** of features to it for the coming years. So, make sure to follow along in our Discord server for updates!
