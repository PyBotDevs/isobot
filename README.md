Isobot lazer is a brand-new project developed by the [iso.dev team](https://github.com/PyBotDevs), as a version of isobot which is sharper than beta.

This open-source project is supposed to represent what the next-generation of isobot will look like, and how it will progress into the future.

## Why a new project?
I wanted to make brand new, cutting-edge features for isobot. But in the process, I ran into some codeblocks which prevented me from doing so efficiently. This is why I decided to completely rewrite isobot as codename 'lazer' which is meant to be more future-proof.

## How can I help?
***PLEASE SUBMIT ISSUES AND PULL REQUESTS TO THE REPOSITORY!*** It helps us work on the project faster c:

## When can I expect a fully-made version?
dnk

## When the project's development is complete, what will happen?
I don't expect the project development to ever fully complete. But at some point, we might merge these changes with [our main project](https://github.com/PyBotDevs/isobot-python) sooner or later.
