Isobot lazer is a brand-new project developed by the [iso.dev team](https://github.com/PyBotDevs), as a version of isobot which is sharper than beta.

This open-source project is supposed to represent what the next-generation of isobot will look like, and how it will progress into the future.

## Why a new project?
I wanted to make brand new, cutting-edge features for isobot. But in the process, I ran into some serious codeblocks which prevented me from doing so. This is why I decided to completely rewrite isobot as codename 'lazer' which is much more future-proof.

## How can I help?
Well, you can make pull requests for new features, and submit current issues, which would help improve the development process!

## When can I expect a fully-made version?
Never- I mean, yes

## When the project's development is complete, what will happen?
I don't expect the project development to ever fully complete. But at some point, we might merge these changes with [our main project](https://github.com/PyBotDevs/isobot-python) sooner or later.

# Invite link
The project doesn't seem ready enough to add the link. We will update this when it is.
