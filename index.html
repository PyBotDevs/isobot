    ABOUT:
        This webpage was made for letting the user get to know about Isobot and it's features.
        Also contains links and bridges to Github.
        Secondary purpose is there too. It's to let Uptimerobot know if the bot is online. 
    NOTES:
        -> This website is also deployed on the running client for Uptimerobot. 
        -> However, since the default deployed client does not have a domain, (most likely) it will redirect the user to the Github Pages deployment (which is still accurate because it needs the client to redirect anyway).
        ->> WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE the deployment services or strategies at any given time without prior notice.
