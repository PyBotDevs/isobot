### Isobot Economy Framework

***This is meant for the developers to use for reference. This can also be used as insight into future releases.***

* High-Low: a simple minigame which makes the user guess whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the hint number
* Rock Paper Scissors: a minigame where the user battles the bot in a game of rps
* Guess the number: a minigame where the user has to guess the correct number that the bot is thinking of (from 1 to 10)
* Bet: I still don't have an idea for this xd
