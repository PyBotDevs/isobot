# Code Tips
### Some code tips you can follow if it's your first time contributing here.

* you should use `not` more than `!=` in statements
* No need to declare variables unless they are random or you use them more than once
* `if a == b: function()`
* `return await ctx.respond()` if ending the command flow in between on sending a message 
* Declaring variable types is sometimes completely useless
* Python isn't JavaScript, you dont have to use () in statements or loops
* An `if` statement doesnt always need a corresponding `else` statement
* `some_list = [a, b, c, d, ...]` in 1 line
* `import a, b, c, ...` in 1 line
* When you are opening a file that is a subdirectory of the cwd you dont need to type full path... *unix logic*
