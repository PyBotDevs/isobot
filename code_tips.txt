#you should use "not" in statements
#no need to declare variables unless they are random and you use it more than once
#if a == b: function()
#return await ctx.send
#declaring variable types is completely useless
#python isnt javascript, you dont have to use () in statements or loops
#an if statement doesnt need a corresponding else statement
#[a, b, c, d, ...] in 1 line
#import a, b, c, ... in 1 line
#when you are opening a file that is a subdirectory of the cwd you dont need to type full path... unix logic
