1. more source of money (e.g. bet, special events, different quests etc.)
2. more ways to spend coins (e.g. buy achevements, badge, ranks etc.)
    2.5. more ways to compete with other users (e.g. leaderboard of ranks, leaderboard of coins, leaderboard of badges and achevements etc.)
3. enhancement of all commands (e.g. more creative way to hunt, different ways to work (like companies and guilds) etc.)
4. i actually had a lot of different ideas on cmds but i sent them to archie, ask me if u also want some (maybe hes gonna say that u copy again....)
5. add weapons (like isobot did) on bankrob and rob cmd, as u cant rob with ur bare hands (buy weapkns such as knife and pistols in shop, new items needed)

(this list will be updated once i got more ideas)
